👋 Hi, I’m Salman Faraj (@salmanfaraj06)

👀 I’m a frontend developer with a keen interest in UI/UX design and Java programming. I'm proficient in Python, Java, and ReactJS.

🌱 I’m currently enhancing my skills in backend development with Node.js and advanced React concepts. I'm on a journey to master the MERN stack.

💞️ I’m a second-year undergraduate at IIT, always open to collaborate on interesting projects, especially those that allow me to leverage and enhance my skills.

📫 The best way to reach me is through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salman-faraj-2617a924b?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app).

😄 Fun fact: I get along with people quickly and consider myself a good team player. 

⚡ When I'm not coding, you'll find me immersed in music - my favorite hobby!

Looking forward to connecting and collaborating with you!
